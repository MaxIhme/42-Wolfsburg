### A Repo with all the 42 Projects I already did 

## Libft
Reprogramming some basic C functions like atoi, memcpy, strchr and many more.

## get next line

Gets a file descriptor (for example to a textfile) and returns a pointer to allocated memory with a whole line in it. Everytime the function get's called it returns the next line until the file ends.

## ft_printf
Reprogramming the function printf with the conversions %c (char), %s (string), %p (pointer), %d (decimal), %i (integer), %u (unsigned), %x (hexadecimal lowercase), %X (hexadecimal uppercase) and %% (%)

## Memory leaks

We fail if we have any memory leaks, segfaults or compilation errors.

## Norm

All code has to fit the 42 Norm wich mainly says how to write clean, simple and understandable code, i.e. only 5 functions per File, with each 25 Lines per function. No "for", "do...while", "switch", "case" or "goto". Only 4 parameters hand over to a function, max. 5 Variables per function and many more rules does the norm include.
