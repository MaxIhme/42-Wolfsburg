## Norm

All code has to fit the 42 Norm wich mainly says how to write clean code, i.e. only 5 functions per File, with each 25 Lines per function. No "for", "do...while", "switch", "case" or "goto". Only 4 parameters hand over to a function, max. 5 Variables per function and many more rules does the norm include.
